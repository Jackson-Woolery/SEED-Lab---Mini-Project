"""Mini-Project for SEED Lab: Group 007.

Requires install of numpy, picamera, time, and opencv. 
Built for Arducam OV5647.

This program uses computer vision techniques and opencv to capture a stream of
images, and performs resize, and convert to gray operations, before detecting
Aruco Markers and the quadrant at which they appear in.

See 'README.md' for more details and instructions.
If you make changes to this file, make sure to update the shared repo;
you may use the instructions included in "raspi_git_instructions.txt"
