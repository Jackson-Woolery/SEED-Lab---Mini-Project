# Mini-Project
Seed Lab Mini Project - Group 007

_Purpose of Repository_
This repository contains programs which detect the quadrant of an Aruco marker appearing on a PiCamera stream, and turns a wheel accordingly.
The geometrical quadrants correspond to the following angles on the wheel:
I: 0 degrees
II: 90 degrees
III: 180 degrees
IV: 270 degrees



_File Organization_
Files are organized by task point numbers as defined in MiniProject.handout.pdf, and named with a short description of their purpose.

4.2_ArucoDetection: Python SHIFT file implementing Aruco marker (and it's respective quadrant) location

4.3_Spin_Motors.ino: Arduino program for spinning motors using the Pololu motor driver shield and PWM signals. 

4.4_readRotaryEncoderRads.ino: Arduino program for reading the rotary encoder's angular position, using the library from the .zip folder.  

4.3_4.4_CombinedSpinAndRead: Arduino program integrating programs 4.3 and 4.4, used to spin the motor and read its current angular position to the serial monitor. 

Encoder-1.4.1.zip: Arduino Library containing an accurate way to read encoders. Including this library is necessary to properly read the rotary   encoders using the Arduino.   

Arduino Motor Driver Shield Datasheet: Datasheet and user guide for the Pololu Dual MC33926 Motor Driver Shield used to control motors using the Arduino.
