This file contains instructions from Jack for using git on the command line 
on Jack's SD card in the Raspberry Pi.
Git is how you should use GitHub repositories on Raspberry Pi. 
It's different than on PC.
I've put this here to save you a little time in Google 
although this stuff is not too difficult to find. 
I have it written down myself, for reference anyways.
Notes are contained in brackets - [ ]
If you put all these lines in the command line in order, 
you will successfully update the shared repository.

IF YOU ARE CHANGING A FILE THAT OTHERS COMMONLY MESS WITH:
Make sure you pull before you make changes, even to your own local document.
If there are changes to a file which haven't been pulled on a file that you're also editing,
it'll make more than a mess trying to merge them or overwrite something;
so let's try to avoid that altogether to prevent complication.
Feel free to contact Jack if you run into this problem and need some help.



[GET TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY / local repository]
[This file path is different if you're on a different system, depending on where you put it]
[I know there is one Pi somewhere where the project directory is accessed at...    cd ~/seed/Mini-Project"]

cd ~/Mini-Project




[PULL any changes to the repository]

git pull origin




[ADD / UPDATE a file you've changed in the repository]
[This is how you select what you're going to commit to the repository]
[If you are adding / updating more than one file, simply put a space between the two files]

git add filename.extension 




[COMMIT your changes to the GitHub repository or something]
[Make sure you add a comment, or the next page is messy]

git commit -m "add your comment here in the quotation marks"




[PUSH your commit to the shared repository]

git push origin




[SIGN IN to your GitHub next, when prompted]
[Put in your username, hit enter...]
[When it asks for your password, it will not show that you're typing, but you are!]
[Type in your password anyways and hit enter.]
[If this doesn't work, hit up Jack if you don't feel like Googling;]
[I'm trying to save y'all time and streamline what I can.]
